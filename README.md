# AcademIQ: Unified Academic Information System 🎓
**One Campus. One Platform.**

AcademIQ is a centralized digital hub designed to streamline college communication. It eliminates the chaos of scattered WhatsApp groups and physical notice boards by bringing notices, calendars, and exam schedules into a single, real-time platform.
